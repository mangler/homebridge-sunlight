# Homebridge Sunlight
[![npm-version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/homebridge-sunlight)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-sunlight)
[![npm-downloads](https://badgen.net/npm/dt/homebridge-sunlight)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-sunlight)


This is a plugin for [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge). It provides contact sensors based on sun position and clouds to automate sun protection. Sensors are opened when the sun is in a defined section of the sky (azimuth) and optionally if an [OpenWeather API key](https://openweathermap.org/api) is provided when the sky is not overcast and sun is above the horizon.


# Installation
Intall via hombridge GUI [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x) or manually via:

1.  Install homebridge (if not already installed) using: `npm install -g homebridge`
2.  Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-sunlight`
3.  Update your configuration file (see below).

# Example Configuration

See `config-sample.json` for an example config. This plugin can also be configured through a GUI like [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x).

## Platform Configuration

| Parameter  | Note                                                                  |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lat`      | Latitude of the location the sun position should be calculated for   |
| `long`     | Longitude of the location the sun position should be calculated for  |
| `apikey`     | Your [OpenWeather API key](https://openweathermap.org/api), optional  |
| `sun` | OpenWeather API minimum sun threshold |
| `overcast` | OpenWeather API maximum overcast threshold |
| `sensors`  | Array of objects containing configuration for the sensors, see below |
| `debugLog` | Debug log output, optional, default: false                 |

## Sensors Configuration

Define contact sensors for one or more sections of the sky, e.g. for windows looking to different directions. Direction is specified in degrees of compass: 0° North, 90° East, 180° South, 270° West. To define overlaps you can use values between -360° and 0° as well as 360° and 720°.

| Parameter   | Note                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`           | Display name of the sensor                                                                                |
| `lowerThreshold` | Left side of sky section within which the sensor should activate |
| `upperThreshold` | Right side of sky section within which the sensor should activate |
| `lowerAltitudeThreshold` | Lower Altitude Threshold |
| `upperAltitudeThreshold` | Upper Altitude Threshold |

**Thresholds example**: If you want the sensor to turn on when the sun is between 0° and 90° azimuth, set the lower threshold to 0 and the upper threshold to 90. See the example configuration file for a basic set-up (north, east, south, west).

This plugin is based on [homebridge-sunsensors](https://github.com/mfkrause/homebridge-sunsensors).
